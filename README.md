# project-local-library
- Assembled the functionality for an application that allows users to search, review and check out books from their local neighborhood.
- Created search and sorting functions to allow users to know what books were available and their rating.
- Coded using JavaScript functions that are built to enable the expansion of the library with little to no need for code refactoring.
